          <h2>Objective:</h2>
          <p>It’s main objective is to make sure that we (students) learned all the things they taught us i.e. HTML and CSS to make the website and also to manage the GitHub.
          </p>
          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p>First assignment of the module CSY1018(Web Development) where the things that I had learned in the classes are used. This website consists of different HTML tags and CSS which I learned in the college. Here I have used different CSS3 properties such as transition, transform, animation and so on. I have also made the website responsive. I took help from different sites and got some ideas to how to make the website which I had cited and given reference at last. The website consists of 5 pages as per the assignment we(students) got. i.e. index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html, cv.html and report.html .
            All this pages consist of all the things that assignment asked for us .
            </p>
          <h2> Module Experience:</h2>
          <p> Personally, before learning about HTML and CSS in the college, I used to think that CSS must be really difficult to learn. As the time passes by and I started to join the classes in the college through online & physically, it is not that difficult. While learning I used to be very excited because every day, week I learned new thing about HTML and CSS. As I learned about it lecture class and use it in practically in tutorial, I was happy to know about it and upgrade my skills. It seemed as if my mind was an empty bucket in the context of CSS and I have added some knowledge of CSS and its properties in it along with HTML tags. </p>  

          <h2>Experience:</h2>
          <p>I, while making the website using the HTML and CSS, got to know about different new tags and it’s use as per the situation. At the beginning, I didn’t even what to do and all. I read that assignment mail for many times then I got some idea in it. At first didn't got the idea exactly how to do it but i tried some as much as I got it. Some pics are given below in the form of before and after about the pages.</p>
            <div class="ort">
              <h4>Before</h4>	
             <img src="img1.jpg" class="image1" alt="This is my home page before">
             <h4> After</h4>
             <img src="aft1.jpg" class="image1" alt="This is my home page after">
            </div>
             <p> In the above picture we can see the difference.At first image,the nav bar was not well placed as it was in second image. In the beginning I just placed the photo as it was and just some text  as in picture. Later on, I made the photo circular and also used hover and animation in that part. I made the photo in circular shape,as I got inspiration from instagram when i used it.</p>
             <p> We can also see the similar background. Personally, I prefer light colors rather then the darker one so by using the HTML color codes I got that color code and used that color in gradient with white.</p>
            <div class="uuu">
         	<h4>Before</h4>
         	<img src="img3.jpg" class="image1" alt="This is contact page before">
         	<h4>After</h4>
         	<img src="aft2.jpg" class="image1" alt="This is contact page after">
         </div>
             <p>    Here also the nav bar was same as it was in the home page. In the first picture i had just made the form,later after I knew that must add our contact details also I added my contact details in another fieldset.</p>
            <div class="uur">
         	<h4>Before</h4>
         	<img src="img4.jpg" class="image1" alt="This is  page before">
         	<h4>After</h4>
         	<img src="aft3.jpg" class="image1" alt="This is  page before">
         </div>
         <p> Before in the CV page, I just uploaded my image, and some details which was arranged using display grid. Later on I got know about the range slider through the w3school,then I used it to display my skills detail.</p>
